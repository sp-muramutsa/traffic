## üìñ Project Overview

This project builds and compares **deep learning models** for classifying traffic signs using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset. The task is a multi-class classification problem with 43 traffic sign categories.

The goal is to explore how different model architectures ‚Äî from basic MLPs to pretrained CNNs ‚Äî perform on real-world traffic images. This has key applications in:

* Autonomous vehicle perception
* Real-time road sign recognition
* Embedded systems for road safety

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

* **Dataset:** GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)
* **Size:** Thousands of labeled images in 43 categories
* **Properties:**

  * Varying shapes, lighting, and angles
  * Images resized to `30x30`, `96x96`, or `224x224` depending on model
* **Target:** Traffic sign class (integer from 0 to 42)

---

## üîß Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

* Resized images to model-compatible shapes
* Normalized image pixel values (`[0, 1]`) or used model-specific preprocessing (`preprocess_input`)
* Converted label folders into numerical class labels
* Created efficient TensorFlow datasets with batching and prefetching for GPU optimization
* Visualized sample images with `matplotlib` and verified image shapes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling & Evaluation

| Model                      | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Notes                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model 0:** MLP           | \~91%          | \~90%         | Baseline dense model. Fast but limited spatial awareness.  |
| **Model 1:** CNN           | \~99%          | \~99%         | Lightweight CNN with pooling. Strong generalization.       |
| **Model 2:** CNN + Dropout | \~99%          | \~99%         | Regularized CNN. Similar accuracy, slower training.        |
| **Model 3:** ResNet50V2    | \~2%           | \~2‚Äì3%        | Underfit due to frozen layers or misaligned preprocessing. |
| **Model 4:** MobileNetV2   | \~99%          | \~70%         | Compact but overfit; poor test performance.                |

## üîç Key Takeaways

* **MLPs** are quick to train but miss spatial features.
* **Basic CNNs** achieve excellent accuracy with minimal compute.
* **Dropout** helps regularization but isn‚Äôt critical here.
* **Transfer learning** requires careful preprocessing and fine-tuning to avoid underfitting.
* **MobileNetV2** overfits without augmentation, hurting generalization.

## üéØ Final Results

* **Best Model:** CNN with 2 Conv layers + MaxPooling
* **Test Accuracy:** \~99%
* **Training Time:** < 10 epochs with early stopping
* **Worst Model:** ResNet50V2 (\~2‚Äì3% test accuracy due to underfitting)
