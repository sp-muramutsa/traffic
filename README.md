## 📖 Project Overview

This project builds and compares **deep learning models** for classifying traffic signs using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset. The task is a multi-class classification problem with 43 traffic sign categories.

The goal is to explore how different model architectures — from basic MLPs to pretrained CNNs — perform on real-world traffic images. This has key applications in:

* Autonomous vehicle perception
* Real-time road sign recognition
* Embedded systems for road safety

## ⚙️ Modeling & Evaluation

| Model                      | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Notes                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model 0:** MLP           | \~91%          | \~90%         | Baseline dense model. Fast but limited spatial awareness.  |
| **Model 1:** CNN           | \~99%          | \~99%         | Lightweight CNN with pooling. Strong generalization.       |
| **Model 2:** CNN + Dropout | \~99%          | \~99%         | Regularized CNN. Similar accuracy, slower training.        |
| **Model 3:** ResNet50V2    | \~2%           | \~2–3%        | Underfit due to frozen layers or misaligned preprocessing. |
| **Model 4:** MobileNetV2   | \~99%          | \~70%         | Compact but overfit; poor test performance.                |

## 🔍 Key Takeaways on this project

* **MLPs** are quick to train but miss spatial features.
* **Basic CNNs** achieve excellent accuracy with minimal compute.
* **Dropout** helps regularization but isn’t critical here.
* *Pre-trained models* like **ResNet50V2** and **MobileNetV2** overfits without augmentation, hurting generalization. They might be great for more complex projects, but the scope of this project is more suited for basic **Convulational Neural Network**.

## 🎯 Final Results
* **Best Model:** CNN with 2 Conv layers + MaxPooling
* **Test Accuracy:** \~99%
